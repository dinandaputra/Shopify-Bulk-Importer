## Minor Issues (Medium Priority) ðŸŸ¡

### Issue #1: Color Metafield Disabled
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Known Limitation
**Impact**: Medium - One metafield type unavailable
**Affected Components**: Smartphone and laptop product creation

#### Description
Color metafield is currently disabled in smartphone and laptop product creation due to required metafield definition setup in Shopify Admin.

#### Technical Details
- **File**: `config/smartphone_metafield_mapping.py`
- **Workaround**: Color metafield creation commented out
- **Root Cause**: Requires manual metafield definition creation in Shopify Admin

#### Resolution Plan
1. Create color metafield definition in Shopify Admin
2. Test metafield creation functionality
3. Re-enable color metafield in mapping
4. Update documentation

**Assigned To**: Shopify API Developer
**Target Timeline**: Next quarter

### Issue #2: Option-to-Metafield Linking Missing
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Enhancement Opportunity
**Impact**: Medium - Manual "Connect metafield" button visible in admin
**Affected Components**: SIM carrier product options

#### Description
While variant-to-metafield linking works perfectly, the option "SIM Carriers" is not automatically linked to its metafield, requiring manual connection in admin.

#### Technical Details
- **Current State**: Variants linked to metafields âœ…
- **Missing**: Option linked to metafield
- **Impact**: "Connect metafield" button appears in admin UI
- **Challenge**: GraphQL productSet linkedMetafield has API conflicts

#### Resolution Plan
1. Research option-specific GraphQL mutations
2. Investigate alternative linking methods
3. Test option metafield linking
4. Implement if viable solution found

**Assigned To**: Shopify API Developer
**Target Timeline**: Future enhancement

### Issue #3: Missing Metaobject Entries
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Data Completeness
**Impact**: Low - Graceful degradation for unmapped values
**Affected Components**: Laptop metafield mapping

#### Description
11 laptop specification values are not mapped to Shopify metaobjects, causing graceful failures during metafield creation.

#### Current Missing Entries
```json
{
  "processor": ["Intel Core i3-1115G4 (4 CPUs), ~3.0GHz", "AMD Ryzen 5 5500U (12 CPUs), ~2.1GHz"],
  "graphics": ["AMD Radeon Graphics"],
  "display": ["13.3-inch FHD", "14-inch FHD"],
  "storage": ["256GB SSD", "1TB HDD"],
  "operating_system": ["Windows 10 Home", "Windows 11 Pro"],
  "keyboard_layout": ["JIS", "AZERTY"]
}
```

**Note**: âœ… **Keyboard Backlight entries resolved** - All keyboard backlight values (RGB, Yes, No, White, Blue, Green, Red) now have complete metaobject mappings and working pipeline.

#### Resolution Plan
1. Create missing metaobjects in Shopify Admin
2. Update metafield mapping configurations
3. Test metafield creation for missing entries
4. Clear resolved entries from missing log

**Assigned To**: Shopify API Developer
**Target Timeline**: Next sprint

## Technical Debt (Low Priority) ðŸŸ¢

### Debt #1: Legacy Service Compatibility
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Managed Technical Debt
**Impact**: Low - Code maintenance overhead
**Affected Components**: Service layer architecture

#### Description
Maintaining both legacy services and new clean architecture services during transition period creates some code duplication.

#### Technical Details
- **Legacy Services**: Original service implementations
- **Enhanced Services**: Clean architecture implementations
- **Compatibility Layer**: Wrapper functions for backward compatibility
- **Migration**: Gradual transition approach

#### Management Strategy
- All new features use enhanced services
- Legacy services maintained for existing functionality
- Gradual migration of existing code to enhanced services
- Full migration planned for Phase 6

**Timeline**: Phase 6 (Testing & QA)

### Debt #2: Test Coverage Gaps
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Continuous Improvement
**Impact**: Low - Risk mitigation
**Affected Components**: Testing infrastructure

#### Description
While core functionality is well-tested, some edge cases and new architecture components need expanded test coverage.

#### Current Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 8/8 passing âœ…
- **Integration Tests**: Core API flows covered âœ…
- **E2E Tests**: Manual workflow validation âœ…
- **Performance Tests**: Basic profiling only

#### Improvement Plan
- Expand unit test coverage for new domain entities
- Add integration tests for enhanced services
- Implement automated E2E testing
- Add performance benchmarking

**Target**: >80% coverage for critical paths
**Timeline**: Phase 6 (Testing & QA)

### Debt #3: Documentation Drift
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Ongoing Maintenance
**Impact**: Low - Developer experience
**Affected Components**: Internal documentation

#### Description
Some internal documentation may lag behind rapid development changes, particularly for newly implemented clean architecture.

#### Areas Needing Attention
- Internal API documentation for enhanced services
- Code comments in complex business logic
- Developer onboarding for new architecture
- Troubleshooting guides for new patterns

#### Management Strategy
- Weekly documentation review and updates
- Documentation updates included in Definition of Done
- Automated documentation generation where possible
- Regular documentation audits

**Timeline**: Ongoing maintenance
