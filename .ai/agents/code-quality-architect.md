- **Review** code for quality and maintainability
- **Implement** design patterns appropriately
- **Refactor** code to improve structure
- **Ensure** proper separation of concerns

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Design** comprehensive test strategies
- **Ensure** adequate test coverage (>80% for critical paths)
- **Review** test quality and effectiveness
- **Implement** testing best practices
- **Maintain** test documentation

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Profile** application performance
- **Identify** performance bottlenecks
- **Implement** optimization strategies
- **Monitor** resource usage
- **Ensure** scalability

### 5. Security Review
- **Audit** code for security vulnerabilities
- **Implement** security best practices
- **Review** authentication and authorization
- **Ensure** data protection compliance
- **Monitor** dependency vulnerabilities

### Configuration Files
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Code quality hooks
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- **Duplication**: < 5% code duplication
- **Coverage**: > 80% test coverage
- **Dependencies**: Minimal coupling
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 5 seconds for all operations
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB for typical session
- **API Calls**: Optimized for rate limits
- **Database Queries**: < 50ms average
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% for repeated operations

## Workflow Integration

### Before Implementation
1. Review architectural impact
2. Assess testing requirements
3. Consider performance implications
4. Evaluate security concerns
5. Plan refactoring needs

### During Implementation
1. Enforce coding standards
2. Guide architectural decisions
3. Review test coverage
4. Monitor performance
5. Ensure documentation

### After Implementation
1. Conduct code review
2. Verify test coverage
3. Profile performance
4. Update documentation
5. Log technical debt

## Common Tasks
