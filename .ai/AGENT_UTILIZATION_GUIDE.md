## Pattern Application

### üõí API Patterns (Shopify Integration)
**File**: `.ai/patterns/api_patterns.md`

#### Core Principles
1. **Always use centralized API client** - Never direct HTTP calls
2. **Respect rate limiting** - Implement backoff strategies  
3. **Comprehensive error handling** - Handle all API error types
4. **Data validation** - Validate inputs and outputs

#### Common Patterns

**Product Creation with Metafields**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern
def create_product_with_metafields(self, product_data: Dict, metafields: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    # 1. Validate input data
    validated_data = self._validate_product_data(product_data)
    
    # 2. Create product via API
    product = self.api_client.create_product(validated_data)
    
    # 3. Attach metafields post-creation
    metafield_results = []
    for metafield in metafields:
        result = self.api_client.create_metafield(
            product["id"], "product", metafield
        )
        metafield_results.append(result)
    
    return {"product": product, "metafields": metafield_results}
```

**Rate Limiting with Retry**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern
@retry_with_backoff(max_retries=3)
async def api_call_with_retry(self, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        return await self.api_client.call(*args, **kwargs)
    except RateLimitError as e:
        # Backoff handled by decorator
        raise
    except ShopifyAPIError as e:
        logger.error(f"API error: {e}")
        raise ProductCreationError(f"Could not complete operation: {e}") from e
```

### üé® UI Patterns (Streamlit)
**File**: `.ai/patterns/ui_patterns.md`

#### Core Principles
1. **User-centric design** - Prioritize workflow efficiency
2. **Consistency** - Maintain patterns across pages
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Show essential info first
4. **Error prevention** - Design to prevent mistakes

#### Common Patterns

**Standard Form Structure**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern
def create_product_form(product_type: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    with st.form(key=f"{product_type}_form", clear_on_submit=True):
        st.subheader(f"üì± {product_type} Details")
        
        # Required fields section
        st.markdown("**Required Information**")
        col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
        
        with col1:
            title = st.text_input("Product Title*", help="Store display name")
        with col2:
            price = st.number_input("Price (JPY)*", min_value=0, step=100)
        
        # Form submission with validation
        submitted = st.form_submit_button("‚ûï Add Product", type="primary")
        
        if submitted:
            if not title or not price:
                st.error("Please fill in all required fields marked with *")
                return None
            return {"title": title, "price": price}
    return None
```

**Template Selection with Preview**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern  
def create_template_selector(templates: Dict[str, Dict]) -> Optional[str]:
    selected_template = st.selectbox(
        "Choose a template to auto-fill form",
        ["None (Manual Entry)"] + list(templates.keys())
    )
    
    if selected_template != "None (Manual Entry)":
        template_data = templates[selected_template]
        
        # Template preview
        with st.expander("üëÄ Template Preview", expanded=True):
            col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
            with col1:
                st.write(f"‚Ä¢ Brand: {template_data.get('brand', 'N/A')}")
                st.write(f"‚Ä¢ Model: {template_data.get('model', 'N/A')}")
        
        if st.button("‚ú® Apply Template"):
            # Apply template to form fields
            for key, value in template_data.items():
                st.session_state[f"form_{key}"] = value
            st.success("Template applied!")
            st.rerun()
```

### üß™ Testing Patterns
**File**: `.ai/patterns/testing_patterns.md`

#### Core Principles
1. **Test pyramid structure** - More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
2. **AAA pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Independence** - Tests don't depend on each other
4. **Meaningful assertions** - Test behavior, not implementation

#### Common Patterns

**Unit Testing with Mocks**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern
class TestProductService:
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_api_client(self):
        return Mock(spec=ShopifyAPIClient)
    
    @pytest.fixture  
    def service(self, mock_api_client):
        return ProductService(api_client=mock_api_client)
    
    def test_create_product_success(self, service, mock_api_client):
        # Arrange
        product_data = {"title": "Test Product", "price": 100000}
        mock_api_client.create_product.return_value = {"id": 123, "title": "Test Product"}
        
        # Act
        result = service.create_smartphone_product(product_data)
        
        # Assert
        assert result["id"] == 123
        mock_api_client.create_product.assert_called_once()
```

**Parameterized Testing**
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct Pattern
@pytest.mark.parametrize("price,expected_valid", [
    (0, False),        # Zero price invalid
    (-100, False),     # Negative price invalid  
    (100, True),       # Positive price valid
    (999999, True),    # Large price valid
])
def test_price_validation(price, expected_valid):
    product_data = {"title": "Test", "price": price}
    
    if expected_valid:
        product = SmartphoneProduct(**product_data)
        assert product.price == price
    else:
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            SmartphoneProduct(**product_data)
```
