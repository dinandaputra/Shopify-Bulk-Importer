## Quick Start Templates

### üöÄ Generic Session Starter
```
I need to work on [SPECIFIC TASK] from the CODEBASE_RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md.

1. First, read the restructuring plan and check current progress
2. Create a todo list for this session
3. Implement [SPECIFIC PHASE/TASK]
4. Work autonomously on read operations
5. Update progress as you go

Begin.
```

### üìö Phase 1: Documentation & Cleanup
```
Let's implement Phase 1 of the restructuring plan. 

1. Read CODEBASE_RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md
2. Create session todos for Phase 1 tasks
3. Start with creating README.md (Task 1.1)
4. Then organize test files (Task 1.2)
5. Clean root directory (Task 1.3)
6. Test everything still works after moves

Work autonomously and use any agents needed.
```

### üîß Configuration Consolidation
```
Time to consolidate configuration files (Phase 2).

1. Analyze all duplicate config files
2. Show me comparison of laptop metafield files
3. Recommend which to keep
4. Consolidate into single files
5. Update all imports
6. Test the application

Use the shopify-api-developer agent for Shopify-specific decisions.
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation
```
Implement [SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE PATTERN] from Phase 4.

1. Review current architecture in services/
2. Create implementation plan
3. Implement without breaking existing code
4. Add tests for new components
5. Update documentation

Use code-quality-architect agent for design decisions.
```

## Session Types

### 1. Analysis Session
**When**: Before making any changes
**Template**:
```
I need to understand [ASPECT OF CODEBASE] before we make changes.

Analyze:
- Current structure
- Dependencies
- What uses this code
- Potential impacts

Don't make changes, just report findings.
```

### 2. Implementation Session
**When**: Ready to make changes
**Template**:
```
Implement [SPECIFIC FEATURE/CHANGE] as defined in [DOCUMENT].

Requirements:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add tests for new code
- Update documentation
- Follow existing patterns

Work autonomously and update todos.
```

### 3. Cleanup Session
**When**: Organizing/moving files
**Template**:
```
Let's clean up [SPECIFIC AREA].

1. List all files to be moved/deleted
2. Create new directory structure
3. Move files in batches
4. Update imports
5. Run tests after each batch

Create backups before starting.
```

### 4. Bug Fix Session
**When**: Something is broken
**Template**:
```
There's an issue with [DESCRIBE PROBLEM].

1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify root cause
3. Propose fix
4. Implement fix
5. Add test to prevent regression

Show me your analysis before fixing.
```

## Effective Communication Patterns

### ‚úÖ DO Use These Patterns

#### Be Specific
```
‚ùå "Fix the configuration"
‚úÖ "Consolidate the 4 laptop_metafield_mapping*.py files into one"

‚ùå "Clean up"
‚úÖ "Move all test_*.py files from root to tests/unit/"

‚ùå "Make it better"
‚úÖ "Implement repository pattern as defined in Phase 4.1"
```

#### Provide Context
```
Good: "I'm working on Phase 2 of the restructuring plan. Today I want to consolidate all configuration files."

Better: "I'm working on Phase 2.1 - consolidating laptop metafield mappings. Yesterday we completed Phase 1. No blockers."
```

#### Set Boundaries
```
"Work on Phase 1 only. Don't touch:
- Any files in services/
- The working variant metafield system
- Any production configuration"
```

### ‚ö° Power Phrases

1. **"Work autonomously"** - Reduces confirmation requests
2. **"Use all necessary agents"** - Enables specialized agent use
3. **"Don't ask for confirmation on read operations"** - Speeds up analysis
4. **"Create a comprehensive plan before implementing"** - Gets better thought-out solutions
5. **"Show me a summary first"** - Gets overview before details
6. **"Update the todo list as you progress"** - Maintains progress visibility

## Power Commands

### üîç Analysis Commands
```bash
# See what needs organizing
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.py" | grep -E "(test_|create_|verify_)" 

# Check for duplicate functionality
grep -r "class.*Mapping" config/

# Find all hardcoded values
grep -r "jufbtk-ut.myshopify.com" .
```

### üìÅ Safe File Operations
```bash
# Create backup before moving
cp -r config/ config_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Move with confirmation
mv -i test_*.py tests/unit/

# Check what would be deleted
rm -i duplicate_*.py
```

### üß™ Testing Commands
```bash
# Test after moving files
python -m pytest tests/

# Test specific module still imports
python -c "from services.product_service import ProductService"

# Run the app to check it works
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

## Efficiency Tips

### 1. Batch Similar Operations
Instead of:
```
"Move test_color_mapping.py to tests/"
"Now move test_laptop_color_fix.py to tests/"
```

Do:
```
"Move all test_*.py files from root to tests/unit/ in one operation"
```

### 2. Use Todo Lists Effectively
Start every session with:
```
"Create a todo list for today's tasks from Phase X of the restructuring plan"
```

### 3. Minimize Context Switching
Complete one phase before moving to the next. Don't jump between phases.

### 4. Leverage Git for Safety
```
# Before risky operations
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: Before restructuring Phase X"

# Create restore point
git tag backup-before-phase-1
```

### 5. Use Agents Strategically
- **Code Quality Architect**: Architecture decisions, patterns
- **Shopify API Developer**: Anything touching Shopify APIs
- **Web Research Specialist**: Best practices, documentation
- **Product Strategy Advisor**: Feature planning, workflows

### 6. Provide Examples
When asking for something new, provide an example:
```
"Create a repository pattern like this:
class BaseRepository:
    def find(self, id): pass
    def save(self, entity): pass
"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI Asks Too Many Questions
**Solution**: Add "work autonomously" and "don't ask for confirmation on read operations"

### Issue: Changes Break Something
**Solution**: 
```
"The last change broke [X]. Please:
1. Revert the last change
2. Analyze why it broke
3. Implement a fixed version
4. Test thoroughly before committing"
```

### Issue: AI Is Doing Too Much
**Solution**: Be more specific about boundaries
```
"ONLY work on Phase 1, Task 1.2. Do not touch any other files or tasks."
```

### Issue: Lost Track of Progress
**Solution**:
```
"Show me:
1. Current todo list status
2. What files have been modified (git status)
3. What phase/task we're on
4. Any blockers encountered"
```

### Issue: Import Errors After Moving Files
**Solution**:
```
"We have import errors after moving files. Please:
1. Find all broken imports
2. Update them to new paths
3. Test each fix
4. Document any sys.path changes needed"
```

## Session Closing

### Standard Closing
```
"Let's wrap up this session:
1. Complete any in-progress tasks
2. Run all tests
3. Commit changes with descriptive message
4. Update todo list marking completed items
5. Create brief summary of what was accomplished
"
```

### Handoff for Next Session
```
"Prepare handoff notes including:
- What was completed today
- What's currently in progress (%)
- Any blockers or issues found
- Priority for next session
- Any decisions that were made
"
```

### Emergency Closing
```
"Quick close:
1. Stash any uncommitted changes
2. Note current task status
3. List any issues encountered
"
```
