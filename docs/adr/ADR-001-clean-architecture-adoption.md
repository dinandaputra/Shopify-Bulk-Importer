# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Adoption

**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  
**Technical Story**: Phase 4 Architecture Improvements  

## Context

The Shopify Bulk Importer codebase had grown organically with tightly coupled services, direct API dependencies, and mixed concerns. This made testing difficult, maintenance costly, and feature addition risky. We needed to improve the architecture to support long-term maintainability and extensibility.

### Problems Identified
1. **Tight Coupling**: Services directly instantiated external dependencies
2. **Mixed Concerns**: Business logic mixed with infrastructure code
3. **Poor Testability**: Difficult to unit test due to external dependencies
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error patterns across services
5. **No Dependency Management**: Manual service instantiation throughout codebase

## Decision

We will adopt **Clean Architecture** principles with the following components:

### 1. Repository Pattern
- Abstract data access behind interfaces
- Enable easy testing with mock implementations  
- Support future data source changes

### 2. Domain Layer
- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Rich domain entities with business rules
- Domain services for complex business logic
- Immutable value objects for domain concepts

### 3. Dependency Injection Container
- Manage service dependencies centrally
- Support constructor injection
- Enable easier testing and configuration

### 4. Centralized Error Handling
- Consistent error processing across all layers
- Structured error responses
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved Testability**: Domain logic can be unit tested in isolation
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error processing and user feedback
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing interfaces preserved during migration

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: More abstraction layers to understand
- **Migration Effort**: Requires gradual migration of existing services
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand new patterns and principles
- **Initial Development Overhead**: More setup required for new features

### Neutral
- **Code Volume**: Slightly more code due to interfaces and abstractions
- **Performance**: Minimal impact due to lightweight container implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (âœ… Complete)
- Implement repository interfaces and implementations
- Create domain entities and value objects
- Build dependency injection container
- Establish error handling system

### Phase 2: Service Migration (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
- Create enhanced services using new architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 3: UI Integration (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
- Update presentation layer to use enhanced services
- Improve error handling in UI
- Enhanced user experience

## Technical Details

### Repository Pattern Implementation
```python
# Abstract interface
class ProductRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def create_product(self, product_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        pass

# Concrete implementation
class ShopifyProductRepository(ProductRepository):
    def __init__(self, api_client: ShopifyAPIClient):
        self._api_client = api_client
```

### Domain Entity Example
```python
@dataclass
class SmartphoneEntity(Product):
    brand: str
    product_rank: Optional[str]
    
    def validate_business_rules(self) -> List[str]:
        errors = self.validate_common_rules()
        if self.price < 1000:
            errors.append("Smartphone price must be at least Â¥1000")
        return errors
```

### Dependency Injection Configuration
```python
def configure_container() -> SimpleContainer:
    container = SimpleContainer()
    container.register(ProductRepository, ShopifyProductRepository)
    container.register_instance(ProductDomainService, ProductDomainService())
    return container
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Maintain Current Architecture
- **Pros**: No migration effort, familiar to team
- **Cons**: Technical debt accumulates, testing remains difficult
- **Decision**: Rejected due to long-term maintenance costs

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity
- **Cons**: Increased operational complexity, overkill for current size
- **Decision**: Rejected as premature optimization

### 3. Hexagonal Architecture
- **Pros**: Clear port/adapter separation
- **Cons**: More complex than needed, learning curve
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of simpler Clean Architecture

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, scalability
- **Cons**: Added complexity, eventual consistency challenges
- **Decision**: Rejected as current system doesn't require event processing

## Validation

### Success Metrics
1. **Test Coverage**: Achieve >80% unit test coverage for domain layer
2. **Maintainability**: Reduce cyclomatic complexity in business logic
3. **Error Consistency**: All errors processed through centralized handler
4. **Development Velocity**: New features require fewer existing code changes
5. **Code Quality**: Improved separation of concerns metrics

### Monitoring
- Track error statistics through centralized handler
- Monitor dependency resolution performance
- Measure test execution time and coverage
- Track feature development time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Lightweight DI container with minimal overhead
2. **Migration Complexity**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility
3. **Team Adoption**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Business Risks  
1. **Development Slowdown**: Maintain existing functionality during migration
2. **Feature Delivery**: Prioritize high-value features during transition
3. **Bug Introduction**: Comprehensive testing of enhanced services

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Async Repository Support**: When Shopify API becomes async
2. **CQRS Pattern**: If read/write separation becomes beneficial
3. **Event Sourcing**: If audit trail and replay become requirements
4. **Caching Layer**: If performance optimization is needed

### Evolution Path
- The architecture can evolve incrementally
- New patterns can be added without breaking existing code
- Container can be extended with advanced features as needed
